I created this with the help of youtube tutorials from the Channel named "Code with Harry". This program has cleared my doubts regarding the speech recognition modules, It was fun creating it!!! 

External modules needed  : 
                          pyttsx3,
                          wikipedia,
                          speechRecognition
